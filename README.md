# Durham CompSci Y1 Programming Summative 1
First programming module summative, involving:

  - Choosing a visualisation from https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery
  - Adapting the visualisation into a reuseable component using classes in Javascript 
  - Finding a new dataset that works with the visualisation and make it work with the class.
  - Writing documentation using JSDoc

Found an 'icicle' visualisation, turned it into a class which allowed for editing of properties such as size, colour and data used. 
Used a python server to run the page to get around CORS limitations.

For marking, focused on these factors:
- Usability and clarity of documentation
- Clarity of code 
- Development of original 
- Quality of example and code
